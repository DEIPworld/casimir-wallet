                  third-party service providers have implemented will be effective against current

                  breaches and security incidents, despite our efforts to discourage our customers

                  <b>Authority of Arbitrator.</b> The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or
                  local court or agency will have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and
                  enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related
                  to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this
                  Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part
                  of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the
                  rights and liabilities, if any, of you and DEIP. The arbitration proceeding will
                  not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or
                  parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of
                  all or part of any claim. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary
                  damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual
                  under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the
                  Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of
                  decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is
                  based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the
                  same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of
                  law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.

                  STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.
                  You and DEIP are instead electing that all claims and disputes will be resolved by
                  arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 10.1
                  above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief
                  as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no
                  judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject
                  to very limited review.

                  NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN
                  ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATE WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER
                  CUSTOMER OR USER. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (a)
                  representative action for public injunctive relief may be arbitrated on a class
                  basis and (b) in the event that the foregoing sentence is deemed invalid or
                  unenforceable with respect to a particular class or dispute for recovery of
                  damages, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration and instead claims and
                  disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 10.7.
